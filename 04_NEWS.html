			<p>The History of HTML
			HTML was first created by Tim Berners-Lee, Robert Cailliau, and others starting in 1989. It stands for Hyper Text Markup Language.
			Hypertext means that the document contains links that allow the reader to jump to other places in the document or to another document altogether. The latest version is known as HTML5.
			A Markup Language is a way that computers speak to each other to control how text is processed and presented. To do this HTML uses two things: tags and attributes.</p>

				Cascading Style Sheets, fondly referred to as CSS, is a simple design language intended to simplify the process of making web pages presentable.
				CSS handles the look and feel part of a web page. Using CSS, you can control the color of the text, the style of fonts, the spacing between paragraphs, how columns are sized and laid out, what background images or colors are used, layout designs,variations in display for different devices and screen sizes as well as a variety of other effects.

				<p>
					JavaScript was initially created to “make web pages alive”.
					The programs in this language are called scripts. They can be written right in a web page’s HTML and run automatically as the page loads.
					Scripts are provided and executed as plain text. They don’t need special preparation or compilation to run.
					In this aspect, JavaScript is very different from another language called Java.
